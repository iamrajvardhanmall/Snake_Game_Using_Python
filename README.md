# Snake_Game_Using_Python
This Python program implements a classic Snake game using the turtle module. The player controls a snake that grows longer by eating food, with the goal of achieving the highest score possible while avoiding collisions.

Features:

1.) Game Setup:
    i.) A 600x600 blue game window with a scoreboard at the top.
    ii.) Snake and food are represented using turtle objects.

2.) Controls:
    Use W, A, S, D keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right.

3.) Game Mechanics:
    i.) Eating food increases the snakeâ€™s length and score.
    ii.) The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
    iii.) High score tracking is included.
    
4.) Dynamic Gameplay:
    The game speed increases as the snake grows, adding difficulty.

Potential Enhancements:
i.) Fix the "High Sccore" typo in the score display.
ii.) Add levels or obstacles for increased challenge.
iii.) Introduce a pause and restart feature.
iv.) Enhance visuals with improved designs for the snake, food, and background.
v.) Display a game-over screen with restart or quit options.
